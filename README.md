# Task-1
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

# About the data:
i used three population datasetf which show population as total, population for male gender and population for female gender.
Varaible -Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Namem, Indicator Code, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 , 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978,1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987,1988,1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.

# Conclusion:
Creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of the data. By doing so, I learned how to effectively represent and interpret data distributions. This process emphasizes the importance of data visualization in making complex data comprehensible, facilitating easier identification of trends, patterns, and anomalies, and aiding in data-driven decision-making.
